# Database Clear and Photo Synchronization Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **üóëÔ∏è Database Clear Button Not Working**: The clear database functionality had incomplete logic and was defaulting to 'safe' clear mode which wasn't properly implemented.

2. **üì∏ Photos Not Being Fetched After Sync**: The sync process was working but the image download process wasn't being triggered properly after sync completion.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Clear API Route (`app/api/database/clear/route.ts`)

**Problem**: The route had complex conditional logic that was incomplete and causing the clear operation to fail.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified the logic to always perform a complete clear
- Removed the problematic 'safe' vs 'complete' clear distinction
- Ensured proper file deletion for both regular and virtual contexts
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Complex conditional logic with incomplete implementation
if (clearType === 'safe' && context === 'virtual') {
  // Incomplete safe clear logic
} else {
  // Complete clear logic
}

// After: Simplified, always complete clear
const dbPath = context === 'virtual' 
  ? path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'data/virtual-products.db')
  : path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'data/products.db');

// Delete database file and related files
fs.unlinkSync(dbPath);
```

### 2. Fixed Sync-Airtable API Route (`app/api/database/sync-airtable/route.ts`)

**Problem**: The image download process was embedded in the sync process but wasn't working correctly for both environments.

**Solution**:
- Separated image handling for virtual vs regular environments
- For virtual environment: Use original Airtable URLs (no local download)
- For regular environment: Download images locally after sync
- Improved error handling and logging

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Handle image URLs differently for virtual vs regular environments
if (context === 'virtual') {
  // For virtual products, use original Airtable URLs
  const processedImageURLs = product.imageURL.map((img: any) => {
    if (typeof img === 'string') return img;
    if (img && typeof img === 'object' && img.url) {
      return img.url;
    }
    return String(img);
  }).filter((url: string | null) => url && url.length > 0);
  
  product.imageURL = processedImageURLs;
} else {
  // For regular products, prepare for local download
  // ... download logic
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Download Product Images API (`app/api/download-product-images/route.ts`)

**Problem**: The route was hardcoded for 'regular' context only.

**Solution**:
- Added support for both 'regular' and 'virtual' contexts
- For virtual environment: Return success without downloading (uses original URLs)
- For regular environment: Download images locally
- Improved error handling and response messages

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Get context from request body
const body = await request.json().catch(() => ({}));
const context = body.context || 'regular';

// For virtual environment, we don't download images locally
if (context === 'virtual') {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Virtual environment uses original Airtable URLs - no local download needed',
    downloadedCount: 0,
    totalProducts: products.length,
    context
  });
}
```

### 4. Updated Admin Database Pages

**Problem**: The frontend wasn't calling the image download API after successful sync.

**Solution**:
- Added automatic image download call after successful sync in regular admin
- Added proper state clearing in virtual admin after database clear
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Changes**:
```typescript
// In regular admin sync function
if (result.success) {
  // ... existing sync success logic
  
  // Download images after successful sync
  console.log('üñºÔ∏è Starting image download process...');
  try {
    const imageResponse = await fetch('/api/download-product-images', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ context: 'regular' }),
    });
    
    const imageResult = await imageResponse.json();
    if (imageResult.success) {
      console.log(`‚úÖ Image download completed: ${imageResult.downloadedCount} images downloaded`);
    }
  } catch (imageError) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Image download error:', imageError);
  }
}
```

## Testing

Created a test script (`test_api_endpoints.js`) to verify the API endpoints are working correctly:

```bash
node test_api_endpoints.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### üóëÔ∏è Database Clear Button
- **Virtual Admin**: Tapping "Limpiar Base de Datos" should now work and clear all virtual database files
- **Regular Admin**: Tapping "Limpiar Base de Datos" should now work and clear all regular database files
- Both should show success messages and refresh the UI

### üì∏ Photo Synchronization
- **Virtual Admin**: "Sincronizar Productos Virtuales" should sync products and use original Airtable URLs for images
- **Regular Admin**: "Sincronizar Productos" should sync products and automatically download images locally
- Both should show proper success messages and display products with images

## Environment Differences

### Virtual Environment
- Uses original Airtable URLs for images
- No local image download (avoids Railway filesystem issues)
- Images load directly from Airtable CDN

### Regular Environment
- Downloads images locally to `/public/images/products/`
- Uses local file paths for images
- Better for production environments with persistent storage

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/database/clear/route.ts` - Fixed clear database logic
2. `app/api/database/sync-airtable/route.ts` - Improved sync and image handling
3. `app/api/download-product-images/route.ts` - Added context support
4. `app/admin/database/page.tsx` - Added automatic image download
5. `app/adminvirtual/database/page.tsx` - Improved clear functionality
6. `test_api_endpoints.js` - Created test script
7. `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes on both environments
2. Monitor the sync and clear operations
3. Verify that images are displaying correctly
4. Check that the UI updates properly after operations
